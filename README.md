These 3D print files are for the hand phantom described in the paper: 
A Multi-frequency 3D printed Hand Phantom for Electromagnetic Measurements,
by Brian B. Beard, Maria I. Iacono, Joshua W. Guag, Yongkang Liu, IEEE EMC Magazine,
[remainder of citation for the paper]

The three files are:
FemaleLeftHandShell.stl           The shell of the nad phantom
WristPlugWithTubeConnectors.stl   The wrist plug with barbed hose connectors
HandStand.stl                     Support stand to hold the phantom 

The purpose of the hand phantom is to simulate the effect of the hand on the RF radiation 
pattern of a handset, not to measure Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) in the hand.
